# Memory Game

The memory game board has a 4 x 4 card grid with the backs facing the user. There are eight pairs randomly arranged on the board with the symbols facing down.

### How to play

Click on a card to uncover the symbol. Click another to uncover it as well and see if both match. If it is a match both cards stay flipped over. If it is not a match the cards flip over again.
The aim of the game is to match all symbols. Once the user has completed the game they are taken to a screen that proclaims they have won. There is also a button that allows them to play again.

**Note:** There is a 3 star skill rating. 3 being the best. 1 the worst. The more moves the user makes the worse the rating.
